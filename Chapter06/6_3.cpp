/*Write a function named fallingDistance that accepts an object's 
falling time (in seconds) as an argument. The function should return the 
distance, in meters, that the object has fallen during that time interval. 
Write a program that demonstrates the function by calling it in a loop that 
passes the values 1 through 10 as arguments and displays the return value.*/
